# FPS-Character-Controller
A FPS controller I made for use in Unity engine games. Its relatively barebones but has a lot of room to expand. You could modify it to use the old input system, but its built to work with the new one.

It uses the PlayerController component to work and is designed so that each individual part (mouselook and playermotor) works independently. So you could use your own motor but my mouselook, for instance.

You can use this however you like.
