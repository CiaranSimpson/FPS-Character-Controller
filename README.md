# FPS-Character-Controller
A FPS controller I made for use in Unity engine games. Its relatively barebones but has a lot of room to expand. You could modify it to use the old input system, but its built to work with the new one.

It uses the PlayerController component to work.

This uses some fuctions from my CiaransLibrary, a copy of which is included in this repo. I cant necessarily guarentee that the one in this repo will always be up to date, so if you want the full thing its probably best to get the one from the CiaransLibrary repo.

You can use this however you like.
