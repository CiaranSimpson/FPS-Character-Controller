# FPS-Character-Controller
A FPS controller I made for use in Unity engine games. Its relatively barebones but has a lot of room to expand. You could modify it to use the old input system, but its built to work with the new one.

It uses the PlayerController component to work and is designed so that each individual part (mouselook and playermotor) works independently. So you could use your own motor but my mouselook, for instance.

 I am releasing this as a learning resource - it took me and embarressingly long time to even try to make one of these on my own, partially because the Standard Assets one makes it look way more complicated than it is. I dont mind if you use this (in any project), modify it, copy it, do whatever you want. 

This FPS Controller currently has the following functionality:

Full 3d movement (forwards, backwards, sideways)

Mouselook with clamping and sensitivity settings.


Planned for future:

Proper jumping

I dont intend to add crouching or leaning functionality, as the intention with this player controller is keeping it as simple as possible - I may fork this project and release a version of this with that functionality, for those who want it
